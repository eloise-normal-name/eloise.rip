I bungled my crucifix, partially because I haven't been practicing my left side
like a bozo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been wanting to take the L3 test before the end of 2025. Now I need
to muster the courage to actually go to an L3 class. It seems scary and
I mostly wanted to take the test just to know I could pass it. L2 still feels
really difficult at times. I want to work towards L2 choreo or heels next, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leg hangs feel pretty okay now... I almost typed "easy" but they're not easy yet.
The first time I tried an inside leg hang, it hurt so much. There's a lot of pole
moves like that I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some flailing I did today:&lt;/p&gt;

Handstand is still scarey, but I feel like my figurehead
is improving. Catgirl is looking good too, but having trouble getting her long beautiful legs
over for the reiko 😍. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I also need to remember to look to the outside for chair spins, it seemed to help a lot and it
looks pretty. I feel like I might try to test into L3 soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The PSO stage" src="../media/images/pso-stage.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of our instructors were performing which was so cool to see. 
It's like we only get little clues about how they might look when performing
from their classes. I was too shy to talk to any of them though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Us in the audience" src="../media/images/pole-babes.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were way far back which made it a little difficult to see. Eventually 
Catgirl and I moved up a single row which felt surprisingly better.
It was funny overhearing Dirty Jeff talk about all the judging rules with Diane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad I went again and that I got to bring Catgirl and that she liked
it too. It's so inspiring to see all the babes being so extra and trying their
hardest to be expressive. I think it's difficult to feel like yourself, and also
difficult to figure out what you're even supposed to feel like, and pole
has been a really great environment for exploring that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Fit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a new pole fit that Diane complimented how it shaped my boobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New pole fit" src="../media/images/new-pole-fit.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we did superheroes in class and now my thighs are sore and gnarly looking 😿.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Pole Dance"></category><category term="Catgirl"></category></entry><entry><title>Heels Combo</title><link href="https://eloise.rip/blog/heels-combo.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:eloise.rip,2025-10-18:/blog/heels-combo.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From a few months ago&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's short, but I like the movements.

I was toast at this point, we had done a lot of leg hang switches and the instructor was like
"a lot of you are looking at your legs sadly so let's do something different". It did feel pretty good
but I was low on arm strength. Also I have a bruise on my hip that's making hangs get into my pocket
kind of tough.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe even better than outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go in the hip pocko&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove inside arm first(?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a goblin squat for insides, don't do full invert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switches go: inside -&amp;gt; pike -&amp;gt; outside -&amp;gt; pike etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push outside leg into pole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open chest, use this to hold back into position correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catgirl took this video of me ♥
