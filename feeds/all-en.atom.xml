&lt;p&gt;It was my second L3 class, and my first with Jana. She checked that I was new in the beginning of class and had a dancey warmup and her sillyness quickly put me at ease, and I feel like I was able to do a lot more than if I were feeling too anxious. I didn't really think about that until the end. I missed having Catgirl to look at though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My legs are pretty bruised but I really like L3, and how it feels challenging and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost my old 2025 intentions unfortunately but I think I did well? I feel a lot better about cooking and have had a lot of fun cooking with Catgirl, which I was super nervous about at first. I managed to get into L3 pole which wasn't even a goal. I didn't run as much as I wanted, but came pretty close to 1000 miles, and that was a pretty artificial goal anyway. I got surgery, a tattoo, and new holes. 1 out 1 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2026 🍔&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still want to keep doing my regular stuff like running and pole and trap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a video game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sew regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make some 3D art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag Catgirl to more pinball tournaments so I can see her be hot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a crow guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a personal and maybe duo pole choreo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a good breakfast burrito&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out and maybe acquire new tattoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink more water 🙃&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terror of Mecha Godzillo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get more Wonka scores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep in touch with friends better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean old junk in apartment and maybe look up new one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do more drug tolerance breaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve blog design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a plan for getting these things done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 was a surprisingly good year for me, if a bit tiring, so I'm not looking to make revolutionary changes to things.

&lt;p&gt;Merp and Berp shared a breakfast and Panther approved of crow treats
[[video:panther-balcony-crows]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so worried about him being lonely or sick in the beginning of the catsitting, but by the end he settled in so well. He had a great appetite too. He still seemed to miss mommy and his friends, understandably, but most of his meows seemed to be for more treats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on patrols every day and made so many precious new silly memories, this time with Catgirl 😻😻😻. I honestly thought that I had already had my last Panther vacation but he still has so much more love to share with everyone apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm catsitting Big P for a week while Diane does xmus in Portland. I think this is the first time he's been over since he lost his hearing. It seems to have a big effect on him. He mustn't be able to know who's around and doesn't know when he'll get to see mommy or the kittens again. Every time I see him he's a bit slower and sicker looking and now he meows a LOT and probably can't even hear himself and it shreds my heart into a horrible miserable pulp. I want him to feel safe and comfy so badly and I feel so helpless and explode into tears constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pear cat" src="../media/images/panther-pear.avif"&gt;
I know he's lived a good cat life, one of the best probably. He's friends with everyone and such a comfort and deserves so much himself. He still has strong paws for grabbing treats from me and remembered how to get to my apartment from the elevator. Despite everything, he's still chugging along and expanding my capacity for love and appreciation of cute moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got visited by Merp and Berp (?) briefly on my balcony, but couldn't get Panther's attention since he can't hear them. They were only around for a moment and I didn't want to startle them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[video:panther-meow]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[video:groof-egg-bamboozle]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groof also has a very cute tube trot

&lt;p&gt;Longlegs likes putting eggs in puddles for some reason. I think they're just used to putting food in water to make it easier to eat. Their friend Fussy disagrees and baps them in the head! I looks like a friendly bap at least. 
[[video:longlegs-puddle-egg-bungle]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried putting treats on a bike seat to see what would happen, but Fussy couldn't hold on very well. I didn't get a video, but Longlegs also was sliding down some parking gizmo due to the rain.

We ended up at the front of the class for some reason despite being
early. This meant I got to see an exciting mini show from Naoko
before class as she tried some combo someone else was talking to
her about. It's such an exciting bonus to class. Also holey moley
there's some baddies in class. I guess all the levels have that,
but they're new baddies and considerably more conditioned. It's
difficult to imagine L4/5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out Naoko's L3 alternates between spin and static? At least I think that's what the situation is. Being a spin class made it more
difficult but I needed the refresher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L2 seemed to be focused a lot on invertaing and L3 seems like
that will be replaced with aerial inverts. There's an intermediate
inversions class that might help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look pretty weird from it being after xgiving, and also because I
forgot to bring my shorts (❓❓❓) so I panic bought some red ones
from the store. I don't really like them and regret not just
using my underpants, though that might have been a bungle too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catgirl and I went to the Phair Castle, along with Diane,
Laura, Brianna, and I think that's it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got super stressed about getting ready, but Catgirl was very
accomodating. I was originally going to workout with Ben, but
I didn't have enough time and abandoned that idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that everyone was running late anyway, which is
what I think happens every year but I always forget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Self Checkout" src="../media/images/xgiving-catgirl-goblin-self-checkout.avif"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the Phair castle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got super drained of battery from being around kids. Julia
started tackling me which was fun and cute but exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Catgirl's first time meeting Pixel, and it went as expected.
Pixel was friendly for a bit and then got swipey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;⚠ Caught Gooning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phair Castle has a nice little nook in Ben's office that we
snuck into. We thought it was private because there's curtains to
cover the entrance and the door to the room was closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there was a window looking right into it from the
balcony and Erin was peeping at us for an unknown amount of time.
It remains a mystery as to how much she saw, but there was a decent
amout to see imo. I think Catgirl was mostly amused but was a
little self-conscious 😟.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;XX-day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Catgirl and I visited Diane's with Eggy Jeff, Dirty Jeff,
and Landy. I didn't take photos of them, but I got a bunch of Panther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[carousel:label=Selfies with Panther and Catgirl;

&lt;em&gt;3 images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catgirl drew a little cat face on his collar, which had been blank
for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also gave Panther a bath! He obviously didn't like it and 
eventually let out a sad yowl 😿. Dirty Jeff used soap instead of
baby shampoo, so I hope his fur is okay. Catgirl and I used the
blowdryer on him after, and he seemed to like it. He got into a very
satisfied looking cat-pear pose 🍐.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;3 images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pole Practice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to do a few shapes at Diane's house. I kicked a cushion
in the second video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[video:xgiving-pole-leg-hang]]
[[video:xgiving-pole-spins]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I don't remember this context but it's cute&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor Panther has lost his hearing it seems. I'm so glad he still seems
like a happy cat. Maybe his hearing loss is related to him wanting to
hang out with everyone, so he could be alterted to any sort of interesting events
that he otherwise might not hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katamari looks really fun but I didn't play too much. Catgirl got me real loopy,
and I had trouble reading the text on the screen, and also got very distracted by Panther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane later commented on how skinny Panther looks in the photos and how she misses her sack of
potatoes which made me pretty sad, but I'm glad he's still hanging out with us and being dopey.
I think it's important to be dopey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, we were visited by the kittens who were happy to display their acrobatics.

I bungled my crucifix, partially because I haven't been practicing my left side

&lt;p&gt;I had been wanting to take the L3 test before the end of 2025. Now I need
to muster the courage to actually go to an L3 class. It seems scary and
I mostly wanted to take the test just to know I could pass it. L2 still feels
really difficult at times. I want to work towards L2 choreo or heels next, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leg hangs feel pretty okay now... I almost typed "easy" but they're not easy yet.
The first time I tried an inside leg hang, it hurt so much. There's a lot of pole
moves like that I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

very often. Sergey is definitely a level above me. You can just tell when someone's average

&lt;p&gt;I had been catsitting Panther, and he kept trying to find a spot to
hang out while I was working. He kept sitting in weird corners on
top of cables, and didn't want to sit on cushions for some reason.
I thought maybe he would sit in my lap if I had pillow and awkwardly hoisted
him up, and it was an accident that he ended up in this position. I didn't
even have my phone on me, so this was actually taken with an ipad(?) 
I had lying around.&lt;/p&gt;

They're missing the seaweed wrap ☹ but was assured it exists somewhere in their massive pile of stuffies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also here's an eyeball I made for a 3yo's birthday. It's supposed to be &lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dianoga"&gt;dianoga&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The PSO stage" src="../media/images/pso-stage.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of our instructors were performing which was so cool to see. 
It's like we only get little clues about how they might look when performing
from their classes. I was too shy to talk to any of them though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Us in the audience" src="../media/images/pole-babes.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were way far back which made it a little difficult to see. Eventually 
Catgirl and I moved up a single row which felt surprisingly better.
It was funny overhearing Dirty Jeff talk about all the judging rules with Diane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad I went again and that I got to bring Catgirl and that she liked
it too. It's so inspiring to see all the babes being so extra and trying their
hardest to be expressive. I think it's difficult to feel like yourself, and also
difficult to figure out what you're even supposed to feel like, and pole
has been a really great environment for exploring that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Fit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a new pole fit that Diane complimented how it shaped my boobs.&lt;/p&gt;

They seem pretty friendly. I've seen crows with the green bands maybe a dozen times now,
but not sure if they're all the same crow.
[[video:green-bandit-greeting]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Bandit can carry two peanuts, but not three, so they call their friend for help.
They can caw with their beak full of peanuts apparently! But honkers need to use their whole body to honk.
Also it seems like pigeons have started sensing that I have food, but they probably can't open peanuts or eggs.
[[video:green-bandit-calls-for-assistance]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their friend heisted the egg away. Maybe they've had a gobbo egg before?
