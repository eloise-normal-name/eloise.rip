&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The PSO stage" src="../media/images/pso-stage.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of our instructors were performing which was so cool to see. 
It's like we only get little clues about how they might look when performing
from their classes. I was too shy to talk to any of them though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Us in the audience" src="../media/images/pole-babes.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were way far back which made it a little difficult to see. Eventually 
Catgirl and I moved up a single row which felt surprisingly better.
It was funny overhearing Dirty Jeff talk about all the judging rules with Diane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad I went again and that I got to bring Catgirl and that she liked
it too. It's so inspiring to see all the babes being so extra and trying their
hardest to be expressive. I think it's difficult to feel like yourself, and also
difficult to figure out what you're even supposed to feel like, and pole
has been a really great environment for exploring that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Fit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a new pole fit that Diane complimented how it shaped my boobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New pole fit" src="../media/images/new-pole-fit.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we did superheroes in class and now my thighs are sore and gnarly looking 😿.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Pole"></category><category term="Catgirl"></category></entry></feed>
