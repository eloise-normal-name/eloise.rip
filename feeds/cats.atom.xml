&lt;p&gt;Even taking out the garbage is fun. Making mundane choores into something to look forward to with a friend is so special.

&lt;p&gt;Merp and Berp shared a breakfast and Panther approved of crow treats
[[video:panther-balcony-crows]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so worried about him being lonely or sick in the beginning of the catsitting, but by the end he settled in so well. He had a great appetite too. He still seemed to miss mommy and his friends, understandably, but most of his meows seemed to be for more treats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on patrols every day and made so many precious new silly memories, this time with Catgirl 😻😻😻. I honestly thought that I had already had my last Panther vacation but he still has so much more love to share with everyone apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm catsitting Big P for a week while Diane does xmus in Portland. I think this is the first time he's been over since he lost his hearing. It seems to have a big effect on him. He mustn't be able to know who's around and doesn't know when he'll get to see mommy or the kittens again. Every time I see him he's a bit slower and sicker looking and now he meows a LOT and probably can't even hear himself and it shreds my heart into a horrible miserable pulp. I want him to feel safe and comfy so badly and I feel so helpless and explode into tears constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pear cat" src="../media/images/panther-pear.avif"&gt;
I know he's lived a good cat life, one of the best probably. He's friends with everyone and such a comfort and deserves so much himself. He still has strong paws for grabbing treats from me and remembered how to get to my apartment from the elevator. Despite everything, he's still chugging along and expanding my capacity for love and appreciation of cute moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got visited by Merp and Berp (?) briefly on my balcony, but couldn't get Panther's attention since he can't hear them. They were only around for a moment and I didn't want to startle them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[video:panther-meow]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tysm to Catgirl for helping out a ton and offering so much necessary love and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Cats"></category><category term="Panther"></category></entry><entry><title>Catamari</title><link href="https://eloise.rip/blog/catamari.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:eloise.rip,2025-11-24:/blog/catamari.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Catgirl and I visit Panther and Diane to get big&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves Panther so much! He meowed a bunch to go on a patrol, but
we needed to wait for Catgirl and Diane to finish the Katamari level,
or else he wouldn't leave the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor Panther has lost his hearing it seems. I'm so glad he still seems
like a happy cat. Maybe his hearing loss is related to him wanting to
hang out with everyone, so he could be alterted to any sort of interesting events
that he otherwise might not hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katamari looks really fun but I didn't play too much. Catgirl got me real loopy,
and I had trouble reading the text on the screen, and also got very distracted by Panther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane later commented on how skinny Panther looks in the photos and how she misses her sack of
potatoes which made me pretty sad, but I'm glad he's still hanging out with us and being dopey.
I think it's important to be dopey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kitten Kartwheel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, we were visited by the kittens who were happy to display their acrobatics.

&lt;p&gt;I had been catsitting Panther, and he kept trying to find a spot to
hang out while I was working. He kept sitting in weird corners on
top of cables, and didn't want to sit on cushions for some reason.
I thought maybe he would sit in my lap if I had pillow and awkwardly hoisted
him up, and it was an accident that he ended up in this position. I didn't
even have my phone on me, so this was actually taken with an ipad(?) 
I had lying around.&lt;/p&gt;

The sound when he shakes his head is amazing. 
It takes him a while to find the kibbles.&lt;/p&gt;
