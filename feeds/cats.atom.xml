He meowed a bunch to go on a patrol, but
we needed to wait for Catgirl and Diane to finish the Katamari level,
or else he wouldn't leave the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;3 images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor Panther has lost his hearing it seems. I'm so glad he still seems
like a happy cat. Maybe his hearing loss is related to him wanting to
hang out with everyone, so he could be alterted to any sort of interesting events
that he otherwise might not hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katamari looks really fun but I didn't play too much. Catgirl got me real loopy,
and I had trouble reading the text on the screen, and also got very distracted by Panther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane later commented on how skinny Panther looks in the photos and how she misses her sack of
potatoes which made me pretty sad, but I'm glad he's still hanging out with us and being dopey.
I think it's important to be dopey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kitten Kartwheel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, we were visited by the kittens who were happy to display their acrobatics.

&lt;p&gt;I had been catsitting Panther, and he kept trying to find a spot to
hang out while I was working. He kept sitting in weird corners on
top of cables, and didn't want to sit on cushions for some reason.
I thought maybe he would sit in my lap if I had pillow and awkwardly hoisted
him up, and it was an accident that he ended up in this position. I didn't
even have my phone on me, so this was actually taken with an ipad(?) 
I had lying around.&lt;/p&gt;

The sound when he shakes his head is amazing. 
It takes him a while to find the kibbles.&lt;/p&gt;
