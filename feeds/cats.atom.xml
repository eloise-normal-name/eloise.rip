&lt;p&gt;I had been catsitting Panther, and he kept trying to find a spot to
hang out while I was working. He kept sitting in weird corners on
top of cables, and didn't want to sit on cushions for some reason.
I thought maybe he would sit in my lap if I had pillow and awkwardly hoisted
him up, and it was an accident that he ended up in this position. I didn't
even have my phone on me, so this was actually taken with an ipad(?) 
I had lying around.&lt;/p&gt;

The sound when he shakes his head is amazing. 
It takes him a while to find the kibbles.&lt;/p&gt;
