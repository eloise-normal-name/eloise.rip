&lt;p&gt;Catgirl and I went to the Phair Castle, along with Diane,
Laura, Brianna, and I think that's it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got super stressed about getting ready, but Catgirl was very
accomodating. I was originally going to workout with Ben, but
I didn't have enough time and abandoned that idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that everyone was running late anyway, which is
what I think happens every year but I always forget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Self Checkout" src="../media/images/xgiving-catgirl-goblin-self-checkout.webp"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the Phair castle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got super drained of battery from being around kids. Julia
started tackling me which was fun and cute but exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Catgirl's first time meeting Pixel, and it went as expected.
Pixel was friendly for a bit and then got swipey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;⚠ Caught Gooning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phair Castle has a nice little nook in Ben's office that we
snuck into. We thought it was private because there's curtains to
cover the entrance and the door to the room was closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there was a window looking right into it from the
balcony and Erin was peeping at us for an unknown amount of time.
It remains a mystery as to how much she saw, but there was a decent
amout to see imo. I think Catgirl was mostly amused but was a
little self-conscious 😟.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;XX-day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Catgirl and I visited Diane's with Eggy Jeff, Dirty Jeff,
and Landy. I didn't take photos of them, but I got a bunch of Panther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[carousel:label=Selfies with Panther and Catgirl;

&lt;em&gt;3 images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catgirl drew a little cat face on his collar, which had been blank
for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also gave Panther a bath! He obviously didn't like it and 
eventually let out a sad yowl 😿. Dirty Jeff used soap instead of
baby shampoo, so I hope his fur is okay. Catgirl and I used the
blowdryer on him after, and he seemed to like it. He got into a very
satisfied looking cat-pear pose 🍐.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[carousel:label=Panther at xgiving;

&lt;em&gt;3 images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pole Practice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to do a few shapes at Diane's house. I kicked a cushion
in the second video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[video:xgiving-pole-leg-hang]]
[[video:xgiving-pole-spins]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I don't remember this context but it's cute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must have been moseying around in the moist for a bit?

&lt;em&gt;3 images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor Panther has lost his hearing it seems. I'm so glad he still seems
like a happy cat. Maybe his hearing loss is related to him wanting to
hang out with everyone, so he could be alterted to any sort of interesting events
that he otherwise might not hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katamari looks really fun but I didn't play too much. Catgirl got me real loopy,
and I had trouble reading the text on the screen, and also got very distracted by Panther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane later commented on how skinny Panther looks in the photos and how she misses her sack of
potatoes which made me pretty sad, but I'm glad he's still hanging out with us and being dopey.
I think it's important to be dopey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kitten Kartwheel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, we were visited by the kittens who were happy to display their acrobatics.

I bungled my crucifix, partially because I haven't been practicing my left side
like a bozo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been wanting to take the L3 test before the end of 2025. Now I need
to muster the courage to actually go to an L3 class. It seems scary and
I mostly wanted to take the test just to know I could pass it. L2 still feels
really difficult at times. I want to work towards L2 choreo or heels next, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leg hangs feel pretty okay now... I almost typed "easy" but they're not easy yet.
The first time I tried an inside leg hang, it hurt so much. There's a lot of pole
moves like that I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some flailing I did today:&lt;/p&gt;

it was 7 people and just about to start. I lost my first match to a complete
n00b which was worrysome, and second to Sergey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how I got ranked so highly, I think it's an artifact of not competing
very often. Sergey is definitely a level above me. You can just tell when someone's average
scores are beating your top scores. I got kinda lucky in my match against him, but that's
how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Pinball"></category></entry><entry><title>Big Baby Panther</title><link href="https://eloise.rip/blog/big-baby-panther.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:eloise.rip,2025-11-07:/blog/big-baby-panther.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite Panther videos&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Babby Hold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been catsitting Panther, and he kept trying to find a spot to
hang out while I was working. He kept sitting in weird corners on
top of cables, and didn't want to sit on cushions for some reason.
I thought maybe he would sit in my lap if I had pillow and awkwardly hoisted
him up, and it was an accident that he ended up in this position. I didn't
even have my phone on me, so this was actually taken with an ipad(?) 
I had lying around.&lt;/p&gt;

They're missing the seaweed wrap ☹ but was assured it exists somewhere in their massive pile of stuffies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also here's an eyeball I made for a 3yo's birthday. It's supposed to be &lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dianoga"&gt;dianoga&lt;/a&gt;
but I didn't make the tentacle part. You can stuff it in your sleeve and use it like a puppet though. 
I made it super quickly and it's not the best quality but am proud of how fast it came out.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The PSO stage" src="../media/images/pso-stage.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of our instructors were performing which was so cool to see. 
It's like we only get little clues about how they might look when performing
from their classes. I was too shy to talk to any of them though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Us in the audience" src="../media/images/pole-babes.avif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were way far back which made it a little difficult to see. Eventually 
Catgirl and I moved up a single row which felt surprisingly better.
It was funny overhearing Dirty Jeff talk about all the judging rules with Diane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad I went again and that I got to bring Catgirl and that she liked
it too. It's so inspiring to see all the babes being so extra and trying their
hardest to be expressive. I think it's difficult to feel like yourself, and also
difficult to figure out what you're even supposed to feel like, and pole
has been a really great environment for exploring that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Fit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a new pole fit that Diane complimented how it shaped my boobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of why I think they're a juvenile is how excited their lil' trots are.
Egg Drop is one of my favorite special crow moves. I need to make a list of them all.

They seem pretty friendly. I've seen crows with the green bands maybe a dozen times now,
but not sure if they're all the same crow.
[[video:green-bandit-greeting]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Bandit can carry two peanuts, but not three, so they call their friend for help.
They can caw with their beak full of peanuts apparently! But honkers need to use their whole body to honk.
Also it seems like pigeons have started sensing that I have food, but they probably can't open peanuts or eggs.
[[video:green-bandit-calls-for-assistance]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their friend heisted the egg away. Maybe they've had a gobbo egg before?
