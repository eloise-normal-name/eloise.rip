&lt;p&gt;Catgirl and I went to the Phair Castle, along with Diane,
Laura, Brianna, and I think that's it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got super stressed about getting ready, but Catgirl was very
accomodating. I was originally going to workout with Ben, but
I didn't have enough time and abandoned that idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that everyone was running late anyway, which is
what I think happens every year but I always forget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Self Checkout" src="../media/images/xgiving-catgirl-goblin-self-checkout.webp"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the Phair castle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got super drained of battery from being around kids. Julia
started tackling me which was fun and cute but exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Catgirl's first time meeting Pixel, and it went as expected.
Pixel was friendly for a bit and then got swipey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;⚠ Caught Gooning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phair Castle has a nice little nook in Ben's office that we
snuck into. We thought it was private because there's curtains to
cover the entrance and the door to the room was closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there was a window looking right into it from the
balcony and Erin was peeping at us for an unknown amount of time.
It remains a mystery as to how much she saw, but there was a decent
amout to see imo. I think Catgirl was mostly amused but was a
little self-conscious 😟.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;XX-day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Catgirl and I visited Diane's with Eggy Jeff, Dirty Jeff,
and Landy. I didn't take photos of them, but I got a bunch of Panther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[carousel:label=Selfies with Panther and Catgirl;

&lt;em&gt;3 images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catgirl drew a little cat face on his collar, which had been blank
for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also gave Panther a bath! He obviously didn't like it and 
eventually let out a sad yowl 😿. Dirty Jeff used soap instead of
baby shampoo, so I hope his fur is okay. Catgirl and I used the
blowdryer on him after, and he seemed to like it. He got into a very
satisfied looking cat-pear pose 🍐.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;3 images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pole Practice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to do a few shapes at Diane's house. I kicked a cushion
in the second video.&lt;/p&gt;

[[video:xgiving-pole-spins]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I don't remember this context but it's cute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must have been moseying around in the moist for a bit?
