Summary: making a voice recorder app

I added a voice recorder app [Voice Recorder](../voice-recorder.html)

It's browser-only, nothing gets uploaded anywhere.

* ask for mic permission
* record audio
* draw a little waveform while it’s recording
* let you play it back locally
* Saving might be broken

Eventually I want the visualizer to look more interesting and also have pitch bands

I have other silly app ideas too, feel free to message or dm about them if you want to collab or have suggestions
