Aileen, our instructor, seemed unimpressed but sympathetic to how tired we were.
I bungled my crucifix, partially because I haven't been practicing my left side
like a bozo. 

I had been wanting to take the L3 test before the end of 2025. Now I need
to muster the courage to actually go to an L3 class. It seems scary and
I mostly wanted to take the test just to know I could pass it. L2 still feels
really difficult at times. I want to work towards L2 choreo or heels next, I think.

The leg hangs feel pretty okay now... I almost typed "easy" but they're not easy yet.
The first time I tried an inside leg hang, it hurt so much. There's a lot of pole
moves like that I suppose.

Some flailing I did today:
