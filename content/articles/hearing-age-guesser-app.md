## What Is the Hearing Age Guesser?

The Hearing Age Guesser is a simple web app that lets you test your high-frequency hearing and estimate your "hearing age." It sweeps a sine tone from 8 kHz up to 20 kHz, and you tap the button when you stop hearing the sound. The app then calculates your estimated hearing age based on the last audible frequency.

## Why Did I Build This?

I wanted a fun, accessible way to visualize hearing loss and make science approachable. Most people lose the ability to hear high frequencies as they age, but it's hard to notice day-to-day. This app makes it easy to check, share, and compare with friends.

## Features

- **Interactive Gauge:** Watch the needle sweep as the tone rises.
- **Waveform Options:** Try sine, square, sawtooth, or triangle waves.
- **Accessible UI:** Large buttons, monospaced age display, and keyboard-friendly controls.
- **Matte, beveled buttons:** Subtle textures for a tactile feel.
- **Mobile Friendly:** Works on phones and tablets.

## How It Works

- Press "Start" to begin the sweep.
- Listen for the tone as it rises in frequency.
- Press "Stop" when you can no longer hear it.
- The app estimates your hearing age and displays it.

## Science Behind It

Human hearing typically ranges from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, but most adults can't hear above 15–17 kHz. The app uses published age-frequency curves to estimate age from the last audible frequency. It's not a medical test, but it's surprisingly accurate for a quick check!

## Open Source & Feedback

The app is open source and built with Pelican, custom CSS, and JavaScript. If you have feedback or want to contribute, check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/eloise-normal-name/eloise.rip).
