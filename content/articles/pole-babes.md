## Pole for the Hole

![The PSO stage](../media/images/pso-stage.avif)

A bunch of our instructors were performing which was so cool to see. 
It's like we only get little clues about how they might look when performing
from their classes. I was too shy to talk to any of them though.

We were way far back which made it a little difficult to see. Eventually 
Catgirl and I moved up a single row which felt surprisingly better.
It was funny overhearing Dirty Jeff talk about all the judging rules with Diane.

I'm really glad I went again and that I got to bring Catgirl and that she liked
it too. It's so inspiring to see all the babes being so extra and trying their
hardest to be expressive. I think it's difficult to feel like yourself, and also
difficult to figure out what you're even supposed to feel like, and pole
has been a really great environment for exploring that.


## New Fit

I also got a new pole fit that Diane complimented how it shaped my boobs.

Then we did superheroes in class and now my thighs are sore and gnarly looking 😿.
