## Previously,

I lost my old 2025 intentions unfortunately but I think I did well? I feel a lot better about cooking and have had a lot of fun cooking with Catgirl, which I was super nervous about at first. I managed to get into L3 pole which wasn't even a goal. I didn't run as much as I wanted, but came pretty close to 1000 miles, and that was a pretty artificial goal anyway. I got surgery, a tattoo, and new holes. 1 out 1 to 2025.

## 2026 🍔

I still want to keep doing my regular stuff like running and pole and trap. 

* Make a video game
* Sew regularly
* Make some 3D art
* Drag Catgirl to more pinball tournaments so I can see her be hot
* Write a crow guide
* Make a personal and maybe duo pole choreo
* Make a good breakfast burrito
* Figure out and maybe acquire new tattoo
* Drink more water 🙃
* Terror of Mecha Godzillo
* Get more Wonka scores
* Keep in touch with friends better
* Clean old junk in apartment and maybe look up new one
* Do more drug tolerance breaks
* Improve blog design
* Make a plan for getting these things done

2025 was a surprisingly good year for me, if a bit tiring, so I'm not looking to make revolutionary changes to things. I might update this as I remember more intentions.
