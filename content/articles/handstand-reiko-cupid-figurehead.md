Feeling better with all of these! Handstand is still scarey, but I feel like my figurehead
is improving. Catgirl is looking good too, but having trouble getting her long beautiful legs
over for the reiko 😍. 

Oh, I also need to remember to look to the outside for chair spins, it seemed to help a lot and it
looks pretty. I feel like I might try to test into L3 soon.
