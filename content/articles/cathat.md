Even taking out the garbage is fun. Making mundane choores into something to look forward to with a friend is so special.

Merp and Berp shared a breakfast and Panther approved of crow treats

I was so worried about him being lonely or sick in the beginning of the catsitting, but by the end he settled in so well. He had a great appetite too. He still seemed to miss mommy and his friends, understandably, but most of his meows seemed to be for more treats. 

We went on patrols every day and made so many precious new silly memories, this time with Catgirl 😻😻😻. I honestly thought that I had already had my last Panther vacation but he still has so much more love to share with everyone apparently.
