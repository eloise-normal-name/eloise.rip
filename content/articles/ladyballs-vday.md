We all had vday baggies like I guess we did in elementary school. I got a lot! I was surprised. I had a hard time coming up with cards myself. My favorite one I made just said "pinball" in the corner. I also boggled Catgirl with one I wrote in different handwriting 😈.

I got so many that I felt like I should have made more. Still have a ton of candy left though. Diane and Catgirl and I got a group pose during the tournament photo, but we won't see it until next month.

I also tried giving Liberty a card (made by Catgirl) because she seems grumpy a lot and maybe it would make her happier.
