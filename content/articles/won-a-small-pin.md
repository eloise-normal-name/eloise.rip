I was walking into Shorty's and I got bamboozled by Dwayne telling me
it was 7 people and just about to start. I lost my first match to a complete
n00b which was worrysome, and second to Sergey.

I don't know how I got ranked so highly, I think it's an artifact of not competing
very often. Sergey is definitely a level above me. You can just tell when someone's average
scores are beating your top scores. I got kinda lucky in my match against him, but that's
how it goes.
