I made these a while ago, and just saw the sushi friend again. I gave it to my friend's kid at some point.
They're missing the seaweed wrap ☹ but was assured it exists somewhere in their massive pile of stuffies.


Also here's an eyeball I made for a 3yo's birthday. It's supposed to be [dianoga](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dianoga)
but I didn't make the tentacle part. You can stuff it in your sleeve and use it like a puppet though. 
I made it super quickly and it's not the best quality but am proud of how fast it came out.
