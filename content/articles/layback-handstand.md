Catgirl was going to be away but cancelled her flight due to weather, and couldn't get into the class I had signed up for.

It was my second L3 class, and my first with Jana. She checked that I was new in the beginning of class and had a dancey warmup and her sillyness quickly put me at ease, and I feel like I was able to do a lot more than if I were feeling too anxious. I didn't really think about that until the end. I missed having Catgirl to look at though. 

My legs are pretty bruised but I really like L3, and how it feels challenging and rewarding.
