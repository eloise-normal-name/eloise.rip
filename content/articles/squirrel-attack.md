I was at the kitty loft waiting for her to come home from surg and
went out to visit her crow friends. They ate all the peanuts I had!

I saw the squirrel to the side and was thinking they were dangerous but they
still got me off guard. Sometimes I see them on reddit getting along with crows,
but now I know they're a hazard. 

Afterwards I went back to the kitty loft and got more treats for them.
