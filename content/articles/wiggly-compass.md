I was running late so I didn't wear a matching outfit which is why it's b&w. 
I was toast at this point, we had done a lot of leg hang switches and the instructor was like
"a lot of you are looking at your legs sadly so let's do something different". It did feel pretty good
but I was low on arm strength. Also I have a bruise on my hip that's making hangs get into my pocket
kind of tough.
