# X-day

Catgirl and I went to the Phair Castle, along with Diane,
Laura, Brianna, and I think that's it?

I got super stressed about getting ready, but Catgirl was very
accomodating. I was originally going to workout with Ben, but
I didn't have enough time and abandoned that idea. 

It turned out that everyone was running late anyway, which is
what I think happens every year but I always forget.

I got super drained of battery from being around kids. Julia
started tackling me which was fun and cute but exhausting.

It was Catgirl's first time meeting Pixel, and it went as expected.
Pixel was friendly for a bit and then got swipey. 

### ⚠ Caught Gooning

The Phair Castle has a nice little nook in Ben's office that we
snuck into. We thought it was private because there's curtains to
cover the entrance and the door to the room was closed. 

Unfortunately, there was a window looking right into it from the
balcony and Erin was peeping at us for an unknown amount of time.
It remains a mystery as to how much she saw, but there was a decent
amout to see imo. I think Catgirl was mostly amused but was a
little self-conscious 😟.

# XX-day

On Friday, Catgirl and I visited Diane's with Eggy Jeff, Dirty Jeff,
and Landy. I didn't take photos of them, but I got a bunch of Panther.

Catgirl drew a little cat face on his collar, which had been blank
for too long.

We also gave Panther a bath! He obviously didn't like it and 
eventually let out a sad yowl 😿. Dirty Jeff used soap instead of
baby shampoo, so I hope his fur is okay. Catgirl and I used the
blowdryer on him after, and he seemed to like it. He got into a very
satisfied looking cat-pear pose 🍐.

# Pole Practice

I got to do a few shapes at Diane's house. I kicked a cushion
in the second video.

## I don't remember this context but it's cute
We must have been moseying around in the moist for a bit?
