The class was fun and encouraging but also painful and difficult.
We ended up at the front of the class for some reason despite being
early. This meant I got to see an exciting mini show from Naoko
before class as she tried some combo someone else was talking to
her about. It's such an exciting bonus to class. Also holey moley
there's some baddies in class. I guess all the levels have that,
but they're new baddies and considerably more conditioned. It's
difficult to imagine L4/5.

It turns out Naoko's L3 alternates between spin and static? At least I think that's what the situation is. Being a spin class made it more
difficult but I needed the refresher.

L2 seemed to be focused a lot on invertaing and L3 seems like
that will be replaced with aerial inverts. There's an intermediate
inversions class that might help. 

I look pretty weird from it being after xgiving, and also because I
forgot to bring my shorts (❓❓❓) so I panic bought some red ones
from the store. I don't really like them and regret not just
using my underpants, though that might have been a bungle too.

I want to practice these some more, but also I really jammed my
right foot.
I think I'm not orienting it properly from the videos.
