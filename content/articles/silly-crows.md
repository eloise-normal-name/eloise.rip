### The Great Egg Bamboozle

This is one of my new favorites. I just turned around and Groof's egg was gone! And then I turned around again and suddenly Groof is right there. They're so swift and quiet.

Groof also has a very cute tube trot

### Longlegs Gets Bapped

Longlegs likes putting eggs in puddles for some reason. I think they're just used to putting food in water to make it easier to eat. Their friend Fussy disagrees and baps them in the head! I looks like a friendly bap at least.

I also tried putting treats on a bike seat to see what would happen, but Fussy couldn't hold on very well. I didn't get a video, but Longlegs also was sliding down some parking gizmo due to the rain.
