This is Green Bandit, who I assume is research crow from UW. 
They seem pretty friendly. I've seen crows with the green bands maybe a dozen times now,
but not sure if they're all the same crow.

Green Bandit can carry two peanuts, but not three, so they call their friend for help.
They can caw with their beak full of peanuts apparently! But honkers need to use their whole body to honk.
Also it seems like pigeons have started sensing that I have food, but they probably can't open peanuts or eggs.

Their friend heisted the egg away. Maybe they've had a gobbo egg before?
