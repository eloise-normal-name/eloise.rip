I'm catsitting Big P for a week while Diane does xmus in Portland. I think this is the first time he's been over since he lost his hearing. It seems to have a big effect on him. He mustn't be able to know who's around and doesn't know when he'll get to see mommy or the kittens again. Every time I see him he's a bit slower and sicker looking and now he meows a LOT and probably can't even hear himself and it shreds my heart into a horrible miserable pulp. I want him to feel safe and comfy so badly and I feel so helpless and explode into tears constantly.

I know he's lived a good cat life, one of the best probably. He's friends with everyone and such a comfort and deserves so much himself. He still has strong paws for grabbing treats from me and remembered how to get to my apartment from the elevator. Despite everything, he's still chugging along and expanding my capacity for love and appreciation of cute moments.

We got visited by Merp and Berp (?) briefly on my balcony, but couldn't get Panther's attention since he can't hear them. They were only around for a moment and I didn't want to startle them.

Tysm to Catgirl for helping out a ton and offering so much necessary love and comfort.
