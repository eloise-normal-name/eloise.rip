I saw a tech messing with it a few weeks ago due to a switch being stuck down causing 
scores to go up continually, so I assume they reset it. 1.2B is good for me but won't last.

I beat Titanosaurous, Gigan, and Ghidorah I think, but didn't get much on the Ghidora fight.
Then Monster Zero started before Planet X, which I don't actually know how to start.
Pretty nice to feel like it's close though. 

117M Carnage was pretty good too üòà
