Summary: Did my first leg hang switch

My inside leg hangs are feeling much better now. Maybe even better than outside.

Things to remember:

- Go in the hip pocko
- Remove inside arm first(?)
- Do a goblin squat for insides, don't do full invert
- Switches go: inside -> pike -> outside -> pike etc.
- Push outside leg into pole
- Open chest, use this to hold back into position correctly
