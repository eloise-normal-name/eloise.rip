I think this might be Groof's honker? Really hard to say. I thought they were Groof
at first because they recognized me, but they're super scared of the egg and tube
and Groof just went at the tube yesterday. 

After they peck the egg, they walk off to the side and give me a sad crow look pretty
similar to what Groof does 😿

A different crow, maybe Groof? comes and helps them with chatters of encouragement.

Part of why I think they're a juvenile is how excited their lil' trots are.
Egg Drop is one of my favorite special crow moves. I need to make a list of them all.
