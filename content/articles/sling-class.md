Last week I tripped in my kitchen and dropped a mug full of hot choco and hurt my bad shoulder 😢. I actually got pretty distraught about it and had to skip L3 pole and had already missed trap due to it being an off week between sessions. 

Catgirl cheered me up and dragged me to sling class with her though! I had fun and despite being L1 it was really difficult.

Catgirl sent me a very impressive home choreo video 😍 so I tried to make one for her too. I really struggled and couldn't do any tricks but I tried my best.
